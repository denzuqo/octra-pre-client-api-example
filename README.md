Example of Octra Pre-client API

In this code, there are only APIs for :
- displaying encrypted balance
- private transfer

This I rewrote using :
- TypeScript
- The latest version of NextJS

[Note]
- Itâ€™s not clean code, but it was typed with love ðŸ’™
- Feel free to customize it with any ideas you have in mind ðŸ§
